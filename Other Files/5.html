Saina Nehwal is an Indian professional badminton singles player.
A former world no. 1, she has won over 24 international titles, which includes eleven Superseries titles.
Although she reached the world's 2nd in the 2009, it was only in 2015 that she was able to attain the
world no. 1 ranking, thereby becoming the only female player from India and overall the second Indian
player – after Prakash Padukone – to achieve this feat.
She has represented India three times in the Olympics, winning a bronze medal in her second appearance.
